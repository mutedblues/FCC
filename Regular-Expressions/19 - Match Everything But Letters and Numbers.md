# Regular Expressions: Match Everything But Letters and Numbers

You've learned that you can use a shortcut to match alphanumerics [A-Za-z0-9_] using \w. A natural pattern you might want to search for is the opposite of alphanumerics.

You can search for the opposite of the \w with \W. Note, the opposite pattern uses a capital letter. This shortcut is the same as [^A-Za-z0-9_].

```javascript
let shortHand = /\W/;
let numbers = "42%";
let sentence = "Coding!";
numbers.match(shortHand); // Returns ["%"]
sentence.match(shortHand); // Returns ["!"]
```

### Instructions

Use the shorthand character class \W to count the number of non-alphanumeric characters in various quotes and strings.

## Code

### Original

```javascript
let quoteSample = "The five boxing wizards jump quickly.";
let nonAlphabetRegex = /change/; // Change this line
let result = quoteSample.match(nonAlphabetRegex).length;
```

### Solution

```javascript
let quoteSample = "The five boxing wizards jump quickly.";
let nonAlphabetRegex = /\W/g; // Change this line
let result = quoteSample.match(nonAlphabetRegex).length;
console.log(result);
```
