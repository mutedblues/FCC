# Basic Data Structures: Add Items Using splice()

Remember in the last challenge we mentioned that splice() can take up to three parameters? Well, we can go one step further with splice() — in addition to removing elements, we can use that third parameter, which represents one or more elements, to add them as well. This can be incredibly useful for quickly switching out an element, or a set of elements, for another. For instance, let's say you're storing a color scheme for a set of DOM elements in an array, and want to dynamically change a color based on some action:

```javascript
function colorChange(arr, index, newColor) {
  arr.splice(index, 1, newColor);
  return arr;
}

let colorScheme = ['#878787', '#a08794', '#bb7e8c', '#c9b6be', '#d1becf'];

colorScheme = colorChange(colorScheme, 2, '#332327');
// we have removed '#bb7e8c' and added '#332327' in its place
// colorScheme now equals ['#878787', '#a08794', '#332327', '#c9b6be', '#d1becf']
```
This function takes an array of hex values, an index at which to remove an element, and the new color to replace the removed element with. The return value is an array containing a newly modified color scheme! While this example is a bit oversimplified, we can see the value that utilizing splice() to its maximum potential can have.

### Instructions

We have defined a function, htmlColorNames, which takes an array of HTML colors as an argument. Modify the function using splice() to remove the first two elements of the array and add 'DarkSalmon' and 'BlanchedAlmond' in their respective places.

## Code

### Original

```javascript
function htmlColorNames(arr) {
  // change code below this line
  
  // change code above this line
  return arr;
} 
 
// do not change code below this line
console.log(htmlColorNames(['DarkGoldenRod', 'WhiteSmoke', 'LavenderBlush', 'PaleTurqoise', 'FireBrick']));
```

### Solution

```javascript
function htmlColorNames(arr) {
  // change code below this line
  arr.splice(0, 2, 'DarkSalmon', 'BlanchedAlmond');
  // change code above this line
  return arr;
} 
 
// do not change code below this line
console.log(htmlColorNames(['DarkGoldenRod', 'WhiteSmoke', 'LavenderBlush', 'PaleTurqoise', 'FireBrick']));
```

## My Notes

The items added in will replace the ones removed - they take on the old index positions.
