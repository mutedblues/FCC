# Object Oriented Programming: Inherit Behaviors from a Supertype

In the previous challenge, you created a supertype called Animal that defined behaviors shared by all animals:

```javascript
function Animal() { }
Animal.prototype.eat = function() {
  console.log("nom nom nom");
};
```
This and the next challenge will cover how to reuse Animal's methods inside Bird and Dog without defining them again. It uses a technique called inheritance.

This challenge covers the first step: make an instance of the supertype (or parent).

You already know one way to create an instance of Animal using the new operator:

```javascript
let animal = new Animal();
```
There are some disadvantages when using this syntax for inheritance, which are too complex for the scope of this challenge. Instead, here's an alternative approach without those disadvantages:

```javascript
let animal = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
```
Object.create(obj) creates a new object, and sets obj as the new object's prototype. Recall that the prototype is like the "recipe" for creating an object. By setting the prototype of animal to be Animal's prototype, you are effectively giving the animal instance the same "recipe" as any other instance of Animal.

```javascript
animal.eat(); // prints "nom nom nom"
animal instanceof Animal; // => true
```

### Instructions

Use Object.create to make two instances of Animal named duck and beagle.

## Code

### Original

```javascript
function Animal() { }

Animal.prototype = {
  constructor: Animal, 
  eat: function() {
    console.log("nom nom nom");
  }
};

// Add your code below this line

let duck; // Change this line
let beagle; // Change this line

duck.eat(); // Should print "nom nom nom"
beagle.eat(); // Should print "nom nom nom" 
```

### Solution

```javascript
function Animal() { }

Animal.prototype = {
  constructor: Animal, 
  eat: function() {
    console.log("nom nom nom");
  }
};

// Add your code below this line

let duck = Object.create(Animal.prototype); // Change this line
let beagle = Object.create(Animal.prototype); // Change this line

duck.eat(); // Should print "nom nom nom"
beagle.eat(); // Should print "nom nom nom" 
```
