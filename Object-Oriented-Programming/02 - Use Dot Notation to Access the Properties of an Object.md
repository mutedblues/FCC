# Object Oriented Programming: Use Dot Notation to Access the Properties of an Object

The last challenge created an object with various properties, now you'll see how to access the values of those properties. Here's an example:

```javascript
let duck = {
  name: "Aflac",
  numLegs: 2
};
console.log(duck.name);
// This prints "Aflac" to the console
```
Dot notation is used on the object name, duck, followed by the name of the property, name, to access the value of "Aflac".

### Instructions

Print both properties of the dog object below to your console.

## Code

### Original

```javascript
let dog = {
  name: "Spot",
  numLegs: 4
};
// Add your code below this line
```

### Solution

```javascript
let dog = {
  name: "Spot",
  numLegs: 4
};
// Add your code below this line
console.log(dog.name, dog.numLegs);
```
